    <header class="header1">The Stream Wheel</header>
    <p>
      A stream wheel[6][12] is a vertically mounted water wheel that is rotated by the water in a water course striking paddles or blades at the bottom of the wheel. This type of water wheel is the oldest type of horizontal axis wheel.[citation needed] They are also known as free surface wheels because the water is not constrained by millraces or wheel pits.[citation needed]

      Stream wheels are cheaper and simpler to build and have less of an environmental impact, than other types of wheels. They do not constitute a major change of the river. Their disadvantages are their low efficiency, which means that they generate less power and can only be used where the flow rate is sufficient. A typical flat board undershot wheel uses about 20 percent of the energy in the flow of water striking the wheel as measured by English civil engineer John Smeaton in the 18th century.[13] More modern wheels have higher efficiencies.
      
      Stream wheels gain little or no advantage from the head, a difference in water level.
      
      Stream wheels mounted on floating platforms are often referred to as hip wheels and the mill as a ship mill. They were sometimes mounted immediately downstream from bridges where the flow restriction of the bridge piers increased the speed of the current</p></div>

    <header class="header2">City infrastructure</header>
    <p>After the industrial revolution, cities in the industrialized countries required to construct and maintain infrastructure facilities to support city growths. Modern water industry was one of the early types of city infrastructure that was born in the early 19th century out of that necessity. There were three types of structures that were unique to the water industry: pumping stations (including water and wastewater), water towers, and dams. In particular, the pumping stations that housed large steam engines in the 19th and early 20th centuries were built intentionally to be symbolic. The building architectures were to communicate a message to the public of safety and reliability, and express their functions. Building designs inherited from beam engine buildings required strong rigid walls and raised floor to support the engines, large arched and multi-story windows to let the light in without compromising wall strength, and roof ventilation such as decorative dormers. These functional features formed the principal of "waterworks style." An example of simple waterworks architectural style is Springhead Pumping Station. More elaborated designs were also used to communicate sacred atmosphere to highlight the importance of critical tasks of the facilities such as in sewage pumping stations. An example is Abbey Mills Pumping Station that employed baroque eclecticism in its design.[3]

      The city infrastructure buildings in this period were more communicative and expressive with their own designs without having to conceal their locations from the public.[3] However, the internal machinery is not exposed to the view from public streets as the buildings provide a decorative "cloak" function.[1] Other examples are Radialsystem (Berlin, Germany sewage pumping station), Kempton Park engine house, Chestnut Hill Waterworks in Massachusetts, United States, Spotswood Pumping Station in Melbourne, Australia, Palacio de Aguas Corrientes in Buenos Aires, Argentina, Sewage Plant in Bubeneƒç, in Prague, Czech Republic, and R. C. Harris Water Treatment Plant in Toronto, Canada. These buildings are considered to be part of the world heritage in the water industry.[4]
